Unfortunately, you cannot directly access the value of `XCom` outside of a task during the DAG definition because `XCom` values are only available at runtime when the DAG is being executed. When defining the DAG (in the Python script), the values are not yet available since they are computed at runtime.

However, you can still achieve dynamic task creation by defining the dynamic tasks within a Python function that is itself a task. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Keep the dictionary creation in Task A (`pre_processing`) using the TaskFlow API.**
2. **Use a second task (PythonOperator) to dynamically generate the BigQuery tasks inside it using the dictionary returned from the `pre_processing` task.**

### Here's the solution:

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from airflow.providers.google.cloud.operators.bigquery import BigQueryInsertJobOperator
from airflow.decorators import dag, task
from datetime import datetime

# Define the DAG
@dag(start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1), schedule_interval=None, catchup=False)
def dynamic_bigquery_load_dag():

    # Task A: Pre-processing function that returns a dictionary
    @task
    def pre_processing(folders_or_tables, dag_config):
        # This simulates the actual dictionary returned from preprocessing
        return {"folder1": ["file1", "file2"], "folder2": ["file3"], "folder3": ["file4", "file5"]}

    # Task B: Dynamically create BigQuery Load tasks
    def create_bigquery_tasks(**kwargs):
        ti = kwargs['ti']
        file_dict = ti.xcom_pull(task_ids='pre_processing')

        # Dynamically generate BigQuery load tasks based on the dictionary keys
        for folder, files in file_dict.items():
            for file in files:
                # Create BigQuery load task for each file
                load_task = BigQueryInsertJobOperator(
                    task_id=f'load_{folder}_{file}',
                    configuration={
                        "query": {
                            "query": f"SELECT * FROM `project.dataset.{folder}`",  # Customize your query
                            "useLegacySql": False,
                        }
                    },
                    dag=dag,
                )
                # Set dependencies (optional, depending on your task structure)
                ti >> load_task

    # Pre-processing task (Task A)
    file_dict = pre_processing("folders_or_tables", "dag_config")

    # Create BigQuery load tasks (Task B)
    create_bq_load_task = PythonOperator(
        task_id='create_bigquery_tasks',
        python_callable=create_bigquery_tasks,
        provide_context=True,
        dag=dag,
    )

    # Set task dependencies
    file_dict >> create_bq_load_task

# Instantiate the DAG
dynamic_bigquery_load_dag = dynamic_bigquery_load_dag()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Task A (`pre_processing`)**: This is a TaskFlow API task that returns a dictionary (e.g., folder names and corresponding file names).
2. **Task B (`create_bigquery_tasks`)**: A `PythonOperator` that uses `xcom_pull` to retrieve the dictionary from the `pre_processing` task. Then, it iterates through the keys and dynamically creates BigQuery load tasks for each file.
3. **Dynamic BigQuery Tasks**: Inside `create_bigquery_tasks`, the `BigQueryInsertJobOperator` is created for each file based on the dictionary.

### Why Can't It Be Done Outside a Task?
The DAG definition process is static and occurs when the DAG is parsed. Since `XCom` values (like the dictionary from `pre_processing`) are only available at runtime, you can’t directly use them outside a task. The dynamic task creation needs to happen during task execution, and that’s why it’s placed inside the `PythonOperator`.

This method ensures that the dynamic tasks are created at runtime when the XCom values are available.
