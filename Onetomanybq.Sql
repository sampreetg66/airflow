To handle cases where the semicolon `;` might appear within values and should be ignored, you need to modify the logic to account for escaped semicolons (e.g., `\;`). You can achieve this by:

1. **Replacing escaped semicolons**: Temporarily replace `\;` with another placeholder (e.g., `{{SEMICOLON}}`) that won't interfere with the splitting process.
2. **Splitting on semicolons**: Perform the split on the remaining semicolons.
3. **Restoring the escaped semicolons**: After splitting, revert the placeholders back to the actual semicolons within the values.

Here's the updated SQL query that accounts for escaped semicolons:

### Example Query:

```sql
WITH replaced_data AS (
  SELECT
    REPLACE(col, r'\;', '{{SEMICOLON}}') AS modified_col  -- Replace \; with a placeholder
  FROM
    `your_project.your_dataset.table_ext`
),
parsed_data AS (
  SELECT
    modified_col,
    SPLIT(modified_col, ';') AS parts  -- Split the string by unescaped semicolons
  FROM
    replaced_data
),
extracted_values AS (
  SELECT
    -- Restore the escaped semicolons in the values
    REPLACE(parts[SAFE_OFFSET(0)], '{{SEMICOLON}}', ';') AS val_0,  -- First value without key
    REPLACE(SPLIT(parts[SAFE_OFFSET(1)], '=')[SAFE_OFFSET(1)], '{{SEMICOLON}}', ';') AS val_1,  -- Extract key_1's value and restore escaped semicolons
    REPLACE(SPLIT(parts[SAFE_OFFSET(2)], '=')[SAFE_OFFSET(1)], '{{SEMICOLON}}', ';') AS val_2,  -- Extract key_2's value and restore escaped semicolons
    REPLACE(SPLIT(parts[SAFE_OFFSET(3)], '=')[SAFE_OFFSET(1)], '{{SEMICOLON}}', ';') AS val_3,  -- Continue for key_3
    -- Repeat for other keys until key_31
    REPLACE(SPLIT(parts[SAFE_OFFSET(31)], '=')[SAFE_OFFSET(1)], '{{SEMICOLON}}', ';') AS val_31  -- Extract key_31's value and restore escaped semicolons
  FROM
    parsed_data
)
-- Now, insert the values into the target table:
INSERT INTO `your_project.your_dataset.target_table` (val_0, val_1, val_2, ..., val_31)
SELECT
  val_0, val_1, val_2, ..., val_31
FROM
  extracted_values;
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **`REPLACE(col, r'\;', '{{SEMICOLON}}')`**: This replaces any `\;` with the placeholder `{{SEMICOLON}}` to avoid splitting on escaped semicolons.
2. **`SPLIT(modified_col, ';')`**: The split operation proceeds as before, but now it only splits on unescaped semicolons.
3. **`REPLACE(..., '{{SEMICOLON}}', ';')`**: After splitting, we replace the placeholders back to real semicolons in the extracted values.

This ensures that any `\;` within values is treated as part of the value, not as a delimiter.

### Final Steps:
- Ensure this logic is applied for all keys from `key_1` to `key_31` (or however many keys you have).
- Insert the extracted values into your target table.
