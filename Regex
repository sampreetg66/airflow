To find lines with more than 31 semicolons (`;`), you can use the following regular expression:

```regex
^(?:[^;]*;){31}[^;]*;.*$
```

### Explanation:
- `^` – Asserts the start of the line.
- `(?:[^;]*;)` – Matches any number of characters that are not semicolons followed by a semicolon. This part is non-capturing.
- `{31}` – Ensures this pattern repeats 31 times.
- `[^;]*;` – Matches the 32nd semicolon.
- `.*$` – Matches the rest of the line (if there are any characters after the 32nd semicolon).

This regex will match lines that contain more than 31 semicolons. If you only want to match lines with exactly 32 semicolons, remove the final `.*`.
