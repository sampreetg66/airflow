To clear all failed tasks of a DAG in Airflow using the Google Cloud CLI, you can use the following `gcloud` command:

```bash
gcloud composer environments run <composer-environment-name> \
  --location <location> dags clear -- \
  --dag-id abc --only-failed
```

Replace the following placeholders:
- `<composer-environment-name>`: Your Composer environment name.
- `<location>`: The region where your Composer environment is hosted.
- `abc`: The DAG ID of the DAG for which you want to clear failed tasks.

This command clears all failed tasks for the specified DAG without affecting successful or running tasks.
